Volatility in finance refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. It is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In simpler terms, it reflects how much and how quickly the price of an asset changes.

High volatility means that the price of the asset can change dramatically over a short period of time in either direction, while low volatility means that the price tends to be more stable and changes less frequently. Volatility is often expressed as a percentage and can be calculated using various statistical methods, such as standard deviation or variance.

Volatility is a crucial concept in finance because it directly impacts investment risk and return. Higher volatility generally implies higher risk because there is a greater chance of large price swings, which can lead to significant losses or gains. On the other hand, volatility also presents opportunities for profit for traders and investors who can effectively manage and predict price movements. Many financial instruments, such as options, use volatility as a key factor in their pricing models.
